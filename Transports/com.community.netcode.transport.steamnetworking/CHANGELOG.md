1. Work with any implamentation of [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) including [Heathen's Steamworks V2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamworks-v2-complete-190316)

## [2.0.0] - 2021-11-25
### Add
- Added support for Steam Game Server Networking APIs

### Changed
- Transport is now named SteamNetworkingTransport as it is no longer limited to peer to peer architectures
- Namespace simplified to Netcode.Transports
- Updated all API calls to test for platform, in the case of UNITY_SERVER being defined the transport will use the SteamGameServerNetworking APIs otherwise it will use the client equivelent SteamNetworking APIs

### Removed
- dependency on SteamManager and SteamManager code has been removed. This makes it easier for users to use whatever initalization logic the user wishes including SteamManager but also custom logic and 3rd party logic such as SteamworksBehaviour from [Heathen's Steamworks V2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamworks-v2-complete-190316)
- pre-packaged Steamworks.NET; this being removed allows the user to use whatever version they please including other 3rd party extensions such as [Heathen's Steamworks V2](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/integration/steamworks-v2-complete-190316)
- Removed unused and unessisary Client API calls such as calls to SteamUser in various debug log messages

## 1.0.0
First version of the Steam transport as a Unity package.
