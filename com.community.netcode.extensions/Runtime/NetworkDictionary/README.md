# How to use NetworkDictionary

In order to make NetworkDictionary available to your codebase you need to use at least Netcode for GameObject version 1.0.0 (stable).  
You'll also have to define the scripting define symbol `NETWORK_DICTIONARY`.  
To do that, go to `Edit` -> `Project Settings` -> `Player` -> `Script Compilation` -> `Scripting Define Symbols` and add `NETWORK_DICTIONARY` to the list.  
Then wait for recompilation and enjoy!
